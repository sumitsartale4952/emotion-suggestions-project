# Emotion Suggestions Project

This project uses speech emotion recognition (SER) to detect a user's emotional state from their speech and then provides personalized suggestions (like listening to music or playing games) to improve their mood.

## Overview

- **Deployment:** Dockerized and ready for integration.
